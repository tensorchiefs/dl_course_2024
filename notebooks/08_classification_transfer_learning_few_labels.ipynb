As pretrained CNN we use a VGG16 architecture that was trained on ImageNet data and was the second winner of the ImageNet competition in 2014.\n","\n","As a check on the quality of the feature representation of the CIFAR10 data, we will use once the pixel-features and once the VGG-features to train a classifier using this 100 labeled data (on average 10 per class). If the VGG-feature are indeed better than the raw pixel values, we would expect to achieve a better classifier when using the VGG-feature compared to the pixel feature.\n","\n","a) Which accuracy would you expect for a classifier which cannot distinguish between the 10 classes and is only guessing?\n","\n","\n","\n","b) Go through the code which is used to set-up, train, and evaluate a CNN classifier using the raw pixel features. Discuss your thoughts on the achieved accuracy (e.g. with your neighbor).\n","\n","\n","\n","b) Now we use the unsupervised constructed VGG features. We want to check, if these VGG features are good enough to train a classifier with only few labeled data and still get a satisfying performance. For this purpose, please complete the code to set up a fully connected NN and run the provided subsequent code to train it and determine its accuracy on the test set. Compare it to the accuracy which we achieve with a RF.
